# Incarcerated Iranian
In this project I will try to make sure we will not forget and leave no innocent Iranian alone in the cruel regim's jails.  
The main goal is to raise the voice of those who were more left behind and make sure their voice will be heard in social media.

## Methodology
We will gather the name and other contextual information of all the people who have been arrested along with all the information we can collect from everywhere and try to share them in Twitter and other social media.
